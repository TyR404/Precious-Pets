        <h3>Trixie</h3>
        <h3>Oct 2005-Feb 2022</h3>

        <p>
          We first met in April 2007. You were found starving in a ditch in
          Darlingford, I was mourning the loss of my dogs Tasha and Max. It
          was the start of a beautiful love story. It took 2 ï¿½ years to
          overcome your separation anxiety. You partook in obedience, agility,
          rally sports, went to dog day care, and ran in off leash dog parks,
          gaining confidence, built trust that I would always come back. I
          gained home repair skills, and learned not to leave shoes or any
          objects I liked within your reach. Along the way we met many
          friends, both 2 and 4 legged.
        </p>

        <p>
          You were such a sweet, smart girl, learning from observation how to
          open fridge door, windows (greeted me in backyard when I knew I left
          you in the house!), screen door (slid it open to get out). You even
          walked up a ramp to the roof to get to me last summer. You loved
          being at the lake. Swimming, kayaking, chasing away bears, going for
          long walks, just being outside.
        </p>

        <p>
          You were my best friend and constant companion, my heart is broken
          having to say goodbye. My joy has vanished, only sorrow is left.
          You're pain free now, playing with all your friends. Your sweet soul
          and spirit will always be with me.
        </p>

        <p>Love you forever,</p>

        <p>
          Sonar was a very loyal companion and gentle dog. His favourite toy
          was his squeaky ball and he would lay outside squeaking it for
          hours. He loved it so much he would fall asleep squeaking. He was
          always patient with other dogs and did not have a mean bone in his
          body.

        <p>
          I will miss this big guy so much every day. <br />

        <h3>2007-2019</h3>

        <p>
          12 years you were in my life. You were my first dog. I remember the
          day I brought you home. Just a fat little butterball of cuteness you
          were. So excited and full of curiosity. You didn't stay little for
          long though. You had so much energy! Runs on my bike with you were
          one of my favourite things to do. It sure calmed your a** down! You
          kept me safe when I was alone. Such a loyal protector you were. I
          can't thank you enough for how you treated my babies. 6 years you
          protected them and loved them as your own. You were so good and
          gentle with them. They love you so much. It was one heck of an
          adventure with you by my side the whole way. I got to watch you turn
          old and grey. It pains me to know you won't be waiting by the door
          when we come home but I know you're with us in spirit. You were a
          good boy.
        </p>

        <p>
          I will love you forever Piggy and I will miss you always. Rest easy
          my handsome boy. Love: Mama, Daddy, Jacob, Jaxon and your fur

          A Parting Prayer Dear Lord, please open your gates and call St.
          Francis to come escort this beloved companion across the Rainbow
          Bridge.
          <br />
          Assign her to a place of honor, for she has been a faithful servant
          and has always done her best to please me.
          <br />
          Bless the hands that send her to you, for they are doing so in love
          and compassion, freeing her from pain and suffering.
          <br />
          Grant me the stength not to dwell on my loss. Help me remember the
          details of her life with the love she has shown me. And grant me the
          courage to honor her by sharing those memories with others.
          <br />
          Let her remember me as well and let her know that I will always love
          her. And when it's my time to pass over into your paradise, please
          allow her to accompany those who will bring me home.
          <br />
          Thank you, Lord, for the gift of her companionship and for the time
          we've had together.
          <br />
          And thank you, Lord, for granting me the strength to give her to you
          now.

        <h3>The Power Of A Pet - KO</h3>

        <p>
          My lovely cat, Ko, passed away February 23rd, 2012. He would have
          been age 16 this year. Ko was the Hydro rescue cat, who was rescued
          by Hyrdo staff from a blizzard where his paws were frozen in the
          snow. The cat was rescued, feet were fixed up, and it lived in the
          hyrdo warehouse. Eventually the cat needed a home, and found its way
          to my place. This owner was undergoing severe bullying for the last
          7 years, and the power of a pet, one cannot describe. The presence
          of this little cat, named Ko, was that it gave one something to come
          home to and comfort one, in times of great bullying. Many days one
          sat crying and this cat would sit close, and make one feel not so
          bad about the bullying. My cat passed away Feb. 23rd, 2012, and it
          waited for me before it passed away, thank you Ko (Kosta Rico
          Sauve). At peace at the Rainbow Bridge Dear Ko. This cat taught me,
          that thru all the bullying, there aways was, THE healing POWER OF A
          PET. Thank you Ko.

          because you've left paw prints on our hearts.

        <p>In Loving Memory</p>

        <p>
          Murphy, you were my precious pet for almost 16 years, how do I say
          good-bye to that kind of love. You gave so much and asked for so
          little in return. When you died, part of me died with you. The pain
          of losing you was so intense that I never knew such pain in my life.
          <br />Your last weeks were tremendously difficult as I watched you
          cope with your cancer and I struggled with the question of doing
          what was best for you. In the end you saved your best gift to me
          till the end by taking that decision out of my hands.<br />
          But even if I had known how intense the pain would be to lose you, I
          would never have chosen to miss that pain because to miss that pain,
          I would have had to miss the dance we shared for almost 16 years.
          Thank you Murphy for the best dance of my life. Till we meet again
          at Rainbow Bridge my MurphyDoodle.
        </p>

        <p>Love, Mommy</p>

          You'll always be my Main Man my dear Max. You came into my life from
          a farmer's field in Morris and brought pure happiness and joy into
          my life.
          <br />
          We shared many great adventures together from Ontario through to
          B.C. Your love of life was infectious. You won everyone's heart, and
          will be sadly, greatly missed by all.

        <p>
          My precious princess Tasha. You're together again with your buddy
          Max, running and playing. You looked after both Max and me, teaching
          us many lessons. You were the best friend and protector I could
          have. You loved exploring and the outdoors. I shall miss your
          bossing me around, letting me know when it was time for walks,
          dinner, or just attention. You were gentle, loving, incredibly
          intelligent and independent. I shall love you forever, and miss you
          immensely.

        <h3>IN LOVING MEMORY OF ZEB Our 9 Â½ Year Old GENTLE GIANT</h3>
        <h3></h3>

        <p>
          ZEB was more than just a pet. He was our best friend and a role
          model. We adopted ZEB from the Humane Society as a 3-month-old
          abused puppy - his coat was tattered and scruffy-looking and he had
          horrible scars on his mouth. He had suffered from malnutrition and
          had a bad odor about him.
          <br />
          In time, with Lots of Love and Care, ZEB grew into a beautiful and
          majestic-looking King Shepherd cross of about 105 lbs. Both people
          and pets we encountered on our daily walks loved ZEB. He was always
          Playful, Friendly, Gentle and he Loved LIFE.
          <br />
          As a role model, he was the Ambassador of Goodwill, welcoming all to
          his 'Field'
          <br />
          ZEB taught us how to get along with others and their pets by his
          example. From watching ZEB, you would learn tolerance of others even
          if some didn't seem caring.
          <br />
          ZEB was a quiet boy who rarely barked. ZEB was a gentle and
          passionate dog who will be painfully missed. When ZEB left us
          suddenly, he took a large chunk of our life with him â¦
          <br />
          We LOVE you ZEB and look forward to meeting you again in the next
          LIFE! Rest in Peace Your Dad and Mom Ken and Val Waldbauer

        <h3>Tribute To Our Zack</h3>
        <h3>1994 to 2007</h3>

        <p>
          ZACK was a best little friend to ZEB and to all of us in his family.
          ZACK was just under 10 lbs and ZEB was 105 lbs! He was frisky,
          mischievous and sweet. Until May 2007 three buddies included ZACK,
          his older brother ZEKE, and ZEB. ZACK left us in May and ZEB left us
          in June. Watching ZACK and ZEB play was magic - ZACK on his hind
          legs mock-slapping ZEB's big face was a rib-splitter. ZEB chased
          ZACK, licked his little head till it was very wet, and all the
          while, ZEKE lay lazily by just watching through half-closed dreamy
          eyes. Then they would all lay down for a long nap till the next
          round. We miss you ZACK but know you are in a good safe place with
          ZEB now looking after you once more!

        <p>
          Zeke was loving, beautiful both inside and out, and our first of the
          boys to come into our home. He enriched our lives - first to arrive
          and the last to leave - our hearts were empty but alive with
          memories! ZEKE was a best big buddy to ZACK and a best little friend
          to ZEB and to all of us in his family. Until November 2008 the three
          buddies included ZEKE, his younger brother ZACK, and ZEB. ZACK left
          us in May ZEB left us in June. Watching our boys play was magic -
          then they would all lay down for a long nap till the next round. We
          miss you ZEKE but know you are in a good safe place with ZEB and
          ZACK now looking out for you once more!

        <h3>Pinky</h3>

        <p>
          I got Pinky when I was six years old and she was just a kitten. We
          grew up in the small town of Lowe Farm and later moved to Morris and
          Winnipeg. Pinky's last home was in Steinbach. She passed on March
          16, 2009 at the age of 19. Pinky had kidney disease. Pinky was a
          very quiet, polite and independent cat. When she was young, she had
          a lot of kittens and she loved having kittens. It was her biggest
          joy in life. She also liked to eat a lot. She didn't play much but
          when she did, it was that much more special. Her favorite toys were
          bouncy balls from those vending machines. Pinky always had her
          tounge out, like she forgot to but it back in her mouth after
          bathing. It was one of the reasons for her name. Pinky was and still
          is everything to me. When other people would be out doing whatever
          it is people do, I would be hanging out with my child, my best
          friend and the love of my life and never wished it to be any other
          way. She made my life whole, content and happy. She showed me that
          the meaning to life is love, the unconditional love that we share. I
          have always and will always love her more than words could possibly
          begin to express. You are my sunshine Pinky and I love you very
          much.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>Pinky in my pocket:</p>

        <p>
          Pinky was sick so I let her go home now I keep her in my pocket so I
          am not alone
          <br />
          I keep Pinky in my book so she is there when I read
          <br />
          and when I am finished she is the last thing that I see
          <br />
          I keep Pinky in my purse because I always have it with me I take her
          out to show the world so her beauty they can too see
          <br />
          I keep Pinky on my nightstand so I can tell her goodnight and in the
          morning when I wake up she is the first thing in my sight
          <br />
          I keep Pinky in my heart because without her it would not beat
          everything else life can take away but Pinky in my heart I will keep

        <p>
          You were a member of our family for so very long - so full of life,
          energy and cuddles. We miss seeing you at the door, waiting to greet
          us and to make your escape into the fresh air. You were committed to
          staying with us, outliving two companions and even making your way
          safely home after being lost outside for two weeks. Even in the end,
          you were so strong to last for as long as you did. We are glad you
          are no longer suffering, but will love you and miss you always.

        <h3>1996 - February 14, 2008</h3>

        <p>
          Rescued by Mommy Sandi you started off so tiny, but you grew into a
          little chubbster with a lot of love and a lot of nibbling. You were
          so cute with your âbabyâ and your short little legs kicked up in the
          air for a belly rub. You were cuddly - on your terms - and a great
          pal to Felix. Always easily spooked, you ventured outside only at
          night, to safely chase the bugs and never went far. It was difficult
          to lose you so suddenly, and we wanted to hold on longer, but we
          knew we had to spare you the pain. We miss you and love you!

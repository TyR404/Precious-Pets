        <h3>Our Mission</h3>

        <p>
          Since the inception of Precious Pet Cremation our mission has been
          to provide a more personal, accessible and dignified alternative for
          those seeking aftercare that truly honours the memory of their
          beloved pets. We are here to help pet lovers carry out their final
          show of appreciation for the devotion and companionship they have
          been so privileged to enjoy, during the time shared together with
          their faithful friends.

        <h3>Why Us?</h3>

        <p>
          Our pets are part of our family. We have experienced the inevitable
          loss of our devoted pets, and although it is always traumatic, we
          feel that through our loss we have been able to gain the insight
          necessary to develop our service, to truly meet the needs of other
          families during this difficult time.
        </p>

        <p>We DO understand what you are going through.</p>

        <p>
          We want to make sure that you are able to have your final wishes
          carried out, exactly as you have planned, because we know how
          important it is to say that final good-bye in your own special way.
        </p>

        <p>
          We believe in letting you, the pet owner, have as much or as little
          involvement in the process, as you feel comfortable with.
        </p>

        <p>
          It is perfectly acceptable for you to remain present for all, or any
          portion of the cremation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          This is called a "Witnessed Cremation" and we offer this choice to
          those who feel the need to "be there" in order to have personal
          final closure.
        </p>

        <p>
          If there is something special you feel needs to be done before or
          after the cremation process, we are willing to accommodate any
          reasonable request. One thing we do not do is paw print impressions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Over the years we have earned the trust of the public and
          Veterinarians, both in the city and other communities by always
          conducting our business in an open and transparent manner and
          treating all clients as we ourselves would like to be treated.

        <h3>The Power-Pak II Pet / Pathological Cremation System:</h3>

        <p>
          We have chosen the Power-Pak II Pet/Pathological Cremation System
          for several reasons, with Safety being a very important one. The
          Power-Pak II is Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed, which is the
          most widely recognized measure of safety compliance. Of course, we
          are licensed and regularly inspected, meeting or exceeding standards
          of operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important reason for choosing The Power-Pak II Cremation
          System is its Environmental Acceptance. Independent testing
          laboratories have tested the Power-Pak II to state and federal
          regulatory standards, which it surpasses.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an Automatic Control System, making this unit fully
          automatic: load it, set the controls, and it completes its cycle
          automatically, shutting itself off upon completion. A lighted
          control panel provides easy verification of every step in the cycle.
        </p>

        <p>
          The conveniently located annunciator panel allows the operator to
          monitor the cremation process from beginning to end. Colour-coded
          lights indicate the status of safety interlocks, burner service, and
          cycle times.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Afterburner System allows complete combustion of smoke and odor,
          resulting in minimal particulate emissions. Retention time of gases
          in the after-chamber is as high as two seconds. Gases traveling in
          the after-chamber experience many 90 degree turns for maximum
          turbulence, retention, and mixing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The exclusive exhaust cooling system cools the exhaust gases before
          they are discharged into the stack and out to the atmosphere. This
          is another very desirable feature that ensures against thermal
          pollution and obnoxious odors associated with hot gases.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unit is furnished with a pollution monitoring and control
          system which constantly regulates and checks stack emissions and
          opacities, taking appropriate action automatically to prevent
          pollution problems before they arise.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unit is constructed with a heavy-duty steel structure and
          casing to ensure consistent and thorough support of all refractory
          materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          Refractory block insulates the chambers, to retain heat. We protect
          this insulation from damage, wear and exposure by lining the
          chambers with rigid, high-temperature, first-quality refractory
          brick designed to withstand the stresses of the cremation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          High-quality refractory and insulating products in standard shapes
          and sizes are used throughout the unit's construction. Hot-surface
          refractories are rated in excess of 3,000 degrees F and are backed
          with insulating refractory. All refractories are steel-encased to
          eliminate uncontrolled air infiltration.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are very satisfied with the performance of our Power-Pak II
          Cremation System, and the efficiency with which it allows us to
          provide this special service to our clients.

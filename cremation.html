      <h2>About The Cremation</h2>

      <br />

      <section>
        <h3>The Cremation Process</h3>

        <p>
          <b>Step 1.</b> Through the use of intense heat, the body is
          transformed back to its basic elements. What would take many years
          to happen naturally is accomplished in minutes by the modern
          technology used in our cremation process? Once the cremation has
          taken place, purified bone fragments are left remaining.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Step 2.</b> There is a cool-down period of 30 minutes to 1 hour
          before the cremation chamber can be opened.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Step 3.</b> Once the cool-down period has passed, the unit is
          carefully cleaned out. The contents are then swept into a
          stainless-steel tray. Along with the bone fragments, there are
          sometimes other non-combustible materials such as a medical
          prosthesis, metal from a collar, etc. These will be removed, leaving
          only the bone fragments for the final step in our cremation service.
        </p>

        <p>
          <b>Step 4.</b> The bone fragments are further processed into a fine,
          sand-like texture. The processed remains of the family pet, now
          termed cremains, are placed into a plastic bag in preparation for
          placement into either a ceramic urn or a specialty urn, as selected
          by the pet owner. The urn is then placed in a white box along with
          our certificate of verification of cremation. The urn is sealed upon
          request by the owner.
        </p>

      <h2>Types of Cremation</h2>

      <br />

      <section>
        <h3>Private Cremation</h3>

        <p>
          When your family pet is brought directly to us at Precious Pet
          Cremation, we will first ensure that any special requests are made
          before the cremation process takes place. Requests may include
          setting aside and saving a lock of hair, the family pet's collar,
          blanket, or other items. Any special items will be placed with the
          pet. Items you are allowed to use are flowers, a letter/note, or a
          favorite toy.
        </p>

        <p>
          You have the option to spend some private time with your pet to say
          your final farewell in our quiet room.
        </p>

        <p>
          Your cherished companion will be treated with the same care,
          dignity, and respect that any person would expect to receive. We
          guarantee that the cremains you receive back from our private
          cremation service will be that of your family pet and only your
          family pet.
        </p>

        <p>
          Depending on the arrangements that have been made, once the
          cremation has been completed, we will return your pets cremated
          remains (cremains) along with a certificate verifying that a Private
          cremation has taken place and signed by our cremation chamber
          operator.
        </p>

        <p>
          As per your request, your pet's ashes will be returned to the
          Veterinary Clinic or Hospital as part of our service.
        </p>
      </section>

      <br />

      <section>
        <h3>Witnessed Cremation</h3>

        <p>
          For those who want to be there during the start of the cremation
          process, we offer the Witnessed Cremation. With this service, you
          may be present for the beginning of the cremation process. A
          "Witnessed Cremation" allows you to ensure the cremation chamber is
          clean and empty before your pet is placed into the cremation
          chamber. Witnessed cremation guarantees your pet's cremains will be
          ready to be taken home immediately following the cremation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          Due to the nature of a witnessed cremation, at least 24 hours'
          notice is necessary to make arrangements for this service. Witnessed
          cremation must be done in the morning before other cremations have
          taken place. There is only one witnessed cremation per day since the
          cremation chamber must be cool to begin the process.
        </p>

        <p>
          We have designed a special, quiet room allowing you to spend time
          with your pet before the cremation takes place. Due to our facility
          only having one designated viewing room, we ask that families take
          their time saying their goodbyes. Please be mindful of other
          families that may also need to use this space. Only one family at a
          time is allowed in our viewing room.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an extra charge for this personalized service, and we
          require notice if you wish to be present.
        </p>

      <br />

      <section>
        <h3>Communal Cremation</h3>

        <p>
          This service is available for those who do not wish to have the
          ashes of their family pet returned. It is for those who are simply
          seeking a less expensive aftercare alternative.
        </p>

        <p>
          During a Communal cremation, several family pets are cremated
          together. Since there is no reliable way to separate the pets or
          their remains, there is no return of ashes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Our Communal cremation service also includes the burial of all
          communal cremains here on our twenty acres of peaceful country
          property.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although there is no return of ashes, we will supply a certificate
          of cremation with the family pet's name and the date of cremation,
          signed by our cremation chamber operator, only if requested, at no
          extra charge.
        </p>

        <p>
          Contact us to discuss any questions you may still have regarding our
          family pet aftercare options so that we can further assist you most
          effectively. We have been doing this for a long time and would like
          to assure you that there is no need to be apprehensive about asking
          questions, as we have probably heard them all before.
        </p>

        <p>
          It would be our privilege to offer you our extensive aftercare
          options to help you design the type of service you feel will be a
          fitting tribute to your client's precious pets.

      <h2>Our Crematorium</h2>

      <br />

      <section>
        <h3>The Power-Pak II Pet / Pathological Cremation System:</h3>

        <p>
          We have chosen the Power-Pak II Pet/Pathological Cremation System
          for several reasons, with Safety being most important. The Power-Pak
          II is Underwriters Laboratories (UL) listed, which is the most
          widely recognized measure of safety compliance. We are licensed and
          regularly inspected, meeting or exceeding standards of operation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another important reason for choosing The Power-Pak II Cremation
          System is its Environmental Acceptance. Independent testing
          laboratories have tested the Power-Pak II to state and federal
          regulatory standards, which surpasses.
        </p>

        <p>
          There is an Automatic Control System, making this unit fully
          automatic. We load it, set the controls, and it completes its cycle
          automatically, shutting itself off upon completion. A lighted
          control panel provides easy verification of every step.
        </p>

        <p>
          The conveniently located annunciator panel allows the operator to
          monitor the cremation process from beginning to end. Colour-coded
          lights indicate the status of safety interlocks, burner service, and
          cycle times.
        </p>

        <p>
          The Afterburner System allows complete combustion of smoke and odor,
          resulting in minimal particulate emissions. The retention time of
          gases in the after-chamber is as high as two seconds. Gases
          traveling in the after-chamber experience 90-degree turns for
          maximum turbulence, retention, and mixing.
        </p>

        <p>
          The exclusive exhaust cooling system cools the exhaust gases before
          they are discharged into the stack and out to the atmosphere. This
          is a desirable feature that ensures against thermal pollution and
          obnoxious odors associated with hot gases.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unit is furnished with a pollution monitoring and control
          system that constantly regulates and checks stack emissions and
          opacities, taking appropriate action automatically to prevent
          pollution problems before they arise.
        </p>

        <p>
          This unit is constructed with a heavy-duty steel structure and
          casing to ensure consistent and thorough support of all refractory
          materials.
        </p>

        <p>
          Refractory block insulates the chambers to retain heat. We protect
          this insulation from damage, wear, and exposure by lining the
          chambers with rigid, high-temperature, first-quality refractory
          brick designed to withstand the stresses of the cremation process.
        </p>

        <p>
          High-quality refractory and insulating products in standard shapes
          and sizes are used throughout the unit's construction. Hot-surface
          refractories are rated more than 3,000 degrees F and are backed with
          insulating refractory. All refractories are steel-encased to
          eliminate uncontrolled air infiltration.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are satisfied with the performance of our Power-Pak II Cremation
          System and the efficiency with which it allows us to provide this
          service to our clients.

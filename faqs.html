      <section>

        <h3>Can I have a paw print impression of my pet's paw as a memento?</h3>

        <p style="text-align: center;">Sorry this is one of the things we do not do.</p>
      </section>

      <section>

        <h3>How can I be sure I'm getting my pet's ashes back when I request a private cremation?</h3>

        <p>You have our word that your pet will be cremated individually and that you will receive only your
          pet's cremains back,
          however, we do understand that some people need a little more assurance than that. We have always
          offered our “Witnessed
          Cremation” option for those wishing to stay for all or any part of the process, so there will be
          absolutely no doubt
          remaining. There is an extra charge for this personalized service if you want to witness the
          cremation, and we do
          require at least twenty-four (24) hours advance notice.</p>
      </section>

      <section>

        <h3>How long does it take?</h3>

        <p>The time involved for a private cremation depends on the size of the family pet, although most will
          take approximately 2
          to 3 hours from start to finish.
          <br />
          <br />
          If you have brought your pet directly to us we try to have your pet's ashes ready for you to pick up
          here usually
          between 3-4 business days.
          <br />
          <br />
          If we have been entrusted with your pet from your Veterinarian, please check with them when you can
          pick up your pet's
          ashes. We have a scheduled service for each location, and that will determine when your pet's ashes
          will be at your
          Veterinarian's, please check with them for specific times.

        <h3>What can I do with the ashes?</h3>

        <p>You may choose a ceramic urn or a specialty urn from our wide selection. Some people keep the urns in
          a special spot in
          their homes, like on a fireplace mantle, dresser, or other area. Others bury the urn, and still
          others scatter the
          ashes.</p>

      <section>

        <h3>Can I bury the ashes?</h3>

        <p>Unless there is a specific bylaw against the burial of cremains in an enclosed container for your
          area of residence, you
          may bury the ashes. Many people have chosen to bury the urn containing the ashes (cremains), as it
          can later be
          unearthed and taken with them if they ever have to move.</p>

        <h3>Cleaning</h3>

        <p>
          We want to assure you that now and always, the health and safety of
          our clients is the top priority for us.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are using Nixall disinfectant/sanitizer. This product can kill
          viruses like HIV and the flu (currently there is no information for
          covid-19). We have chosen to add this product to our cleaning
          routine to do our very best to protect our clients.
        </p>

        <p>
          We are cleaning and disinfecting in our offices and any area where
          we have more traffic. All surfaces will be cleaned even more often.

        <h3>Why Choose Precious Pets?</h3>

        <p>
          We have been in the business of looking after pets (both our own and
          those belonging to other people) for over 47 years now. During the
          last 47 years we have also been providing the aftercare for those
          precious pets through our specialized pet cremation service.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          Since we have been pet owners for over forty seven years we feel we
          can offer a more empathetic approach to the whole pet loss
          experience than someone who is simply in the cremation business, and
          not so intimately involved with all aspects of pet care.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          We have, sadly, had to make the final arrangements for many of our
          own family pets throughout the years and honestly feel that a
          dignified cremation is the ultimate way to express our gratitude for
          the time shared together. We would be honored to provide you with
          the respectful, personal service that you and your pet deserve.
          After you have made the final aftercare arrangements with your Vet,
          including choosing the type of service desired, (witnessed, private,
          or communal cremation), please feel free to contact us to discuss
          the details of your personal pet cremation needs. No reasonable
          special request will be denied. One thing we do not do is paw print
          impressions.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          If your pet is not at a Veterinary Clinic, you may contact us
          directly to arrange for service, although there is an additional
          charge for pick up from, and/or return to a private home.

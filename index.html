        <h3>Why Choose Precious Pets?</h3>

        <p>
          Precious Pet is a family-owned business that has been in business
          for over 47 years. We have been looking after both our pets and
          those belonging to others. We feel we can offer a more empathetic
          approach to the pet loss experience rather than someone who is
          simply in the cremation business.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          During the last 47 years, we have provided aftercare for those
          precious pets through our specialized pet cremation services.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          We have had to make the final arrangements for many of our family
          pets throughout the years. We feel that a dignified cremation is an
          ultimate way to express our gratitude for the time together. We
          would be honored to provide you with the respectful, personal
          service you and your pet deserve. After you have made the final
          aftercare arrangements with your Vet, including choosing the type of
          service desired (witnessed, private, or communal cremation), please
          feel free to contact us to discuss the details of your personal pet
          cremation needs. Reasonable special requests will not be denied. One
          thing we do not offer is paw print impressions.
        </p>

        <br />

        <p>
          If your pet is not at a Veterinary Clinic, you can drop off your
          deceased pet at our facility. You may also contact us directly to
          arrange for service, although there is an additional charge for pick
          up or return to a private home.

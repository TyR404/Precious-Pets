        <br />

        <section>
          <h3>The Cremation Process</h3>

          <p>
            <b>Step 1.</b> Through the use of intense heat, the body is
            transformed back to its basic elements. What would take many years
            to happen naturally is accomplished in minutes by the modern
            technology used in our cremation process. Once cremation has taken
            place, there are only purified bone fragments remaining.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 2.</b> There is a cool down period of Â½ to 1 hour before the
            cremation chamber can be opened.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 3.</b> Once the cool down period has passed, the unit is
            very carefully cleaned out and the contents are swept into a
            stainless-steel tray. Along with the bone fragments there are
            sometimes other non-combustible materials such as a medical
            prosthesis, or metal from a collar, etc. remaining and these will be
            removed leaving only the bone fragments for the final step in our
            cremation service.
          </p>

          <p>
            <b>Step 4.</b> The bone fragments are further processed into a fine,
            sand-like texture. The processed remains of the family pet, now
            termed "cremains", are placed into a plastic bag in preparation for
            placement into either a ceramic urn, or other specialty urn, as
            selected by the pet owner. The urn is then placed in a white box
            along with our certificate of verification of cremation. The urn is
            only sealed upon request by owner.

        <h2>Types of Cremation</h2>

        <br />

        <section>
          <h3>Private Cremation</h3>

          <p>
            When your family pet is brought directly to us at Precious Pet
            Cremation, we will first ensure that any special requests made prior
            to cremation taking place are carried out. This might include
            setting aside and saving a lock of hair, the family pet's collar,
            blanket or other items. This is also when any special items would be
            placed with the pet, such as flowers, a letter or note, or a
            favorite toy.
          </p>

          <p>
            You may spend some private time with your pet to say your final
            farewell in our quiet room, if you wish.
          </p>

          <p>
            Your cherished companion will be treated with the same care, dignity
            and respect, that any person would expect to receive. We absolutely
            guarantee that the cremains you receive back from our private
            cremation service will be that of your family pet, and only your
            family pet.
          </p>

          <p>
            We do not feel that words alone are enough to completely assure
            every one of our integrity, considering that most pet owners have
            never personally met us. For those who require their own, personal
            proof that they are receiving exactly, and only what they should, we
            also offer our witnessed cremation service.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the arrangements that have been made, once the
            cremation has been completed we will return your pet's cremated
            remains, (cremains) along with a certificate verifying that a
            Private cremation has taken place, and signed by our cremation
            chamber operator.
          </p>

          <p>
            As per your request, your pet's ashes will be returned to the
            Veterinary Clinic or Hospital as part of our service.
          </p>

          <h3>Witnessed Cremation</h3>

          <p>
            For those who feel the need to be there during the start of the
            cremation process, we offer the "Witnessed Cremation". With this
            type of service, you may be present for the beginning of the
            cremation process. A "Witnessed Cremation" allows you to ensure the
            cremation chamber is clean and empty before your pet is placed into
            the cremation chamber. The process of a "witnessed cremation"
            guarantees your pet's cremains will be ready to be taken home
            immediately following the cremation process.
          </p>

          <p>
            Due to the nature of a witnessed cremation, at least 24 hours'
            notice is necessary in order to make arrangements for this type of
            service, as it must be done in the morning, before any other
            cremations have taken place. There is only one witnessed cremation
            per day, since the cremation chamber must be cool to begin the
            process.
          </p>

          <p>
            We have designed a special quiet room, allowing you to spend some
            time with your pet before the cremation process takes place. Due to
            our facility only having one designated "viewing room", we ask that
            families take their time saying their goodbyes, but to please be
            considerate of other families that may also need to use this space.
            Only one family at a time is allowed in our "viewing room".
          </p>

          <p>
            There is an extra charge for this personalized service, and we do
            require advance notice if you wish to be present.
          </p>

          <h3>Communal Cremation</h3>

          <p>
            This type of cremation service is available for those who do not
            wish to have the ashes of their family pet returned, and for those
            who are simply seeking a less expensive aftercare alternative.
          </p>

          <p>
            During a Communal cremation several family pets are cremated
            together and since there is no reliable way to completely separate
            the pets or their remains, there is no return of ashes.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our Communal cremation service also includes the burial of all
            communal cremains here on our twenty acres of peaceful country
            property.
          </p>

          <p>
            Although there is no return of ashes, we will supply a certificate
            of cremation with the family pet's name and the date of cremation,
            signed by our cremation chamber operator, only if requested, at no
            extra charge.
          </p>

          <p>
            Please contact us to discuss any questions you may still have
            regarding our family pet aftercare options so that we may further
            assist you in the most effective manner. We have been doing this for
            a long time and would like to assure you that there is no need to be
            apprehensive about asking questions, as we have probably heard them
            all before.
          </p>

          <p>
            It would be our privilege to offer you our extensive aftercare
            options to help you design exactly the type of service you feel will
            be a fitting tribute to your clients' precious pets.
